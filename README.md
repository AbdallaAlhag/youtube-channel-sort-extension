# YouTube Channel Sort Chrome Extension [PROJECT CANCELLED]

Can't really sort videos on the youtube channel search query since it's an infinite load and we only get blocks of videos at a time.
We could sort blocks as they load but that defeats the whole purpose of the extension as it doesn't give us true sorting.
Tried to scroll down but some channels have to many videos which takes minutes at a time to load the full videos and most likely it would be better
if we could have control of the fetch data that gets called during the infinite scroll at the bottom so we could force that and cancel any page loads.
